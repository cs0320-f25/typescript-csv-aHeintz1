# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.

Parser doesn't handle quoted fields with commas, the empty fields aren't kept, and there is no way to see the different row lengths

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

LLM suggeseted that large file streaming support, detailed parse errors, and to handle different functions such as semicolon and tab are missing.

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Functionality:
    As a user I want quoted fields with commas to be formated so last name, first name aren't in different fields and remain the a single field. This ensures that names and other datas that split with a comma stay in the same field, which is needed to keep the integrety of the data. This idea came from me while looking at the csv file it is must need that names stay together, but reinforced by LLM. 

    As a user a crucial need for me to have a good CSV file is for the colums to be consistent so the data wont be misaligned and make the csv file incorrect. This idea what thought about by me when thinking how I can make sure that the data is kept true. 

    Extensibility:
    As a user I need the parser to know whether the first row contains headers so the rest of the data falls into place correctly. Having the data in the right place will help me find all the data in the same field instead of it getting misplaced. This was though of by the LLM

    As a user I want errors to be returned as structured error objects instead of console logs so that everything runs smoother. This improves usability by allowing me to capture the error, inspecte it and respond. This was thought of by the LLM. It leaned towards edge cases but really emphasized ease of use.
